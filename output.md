### Production Technology 1 - LFT - Chair of Manufacturing Technology

###### introduction

**Classification of manufacturing processes according to DIN 8580**

###### archetypes

 Definition archetypes

 Creating a solid body from shapeless material by creating cohesion

 • Good raw material utilization 
 • Adjustable mechanical properties of the workpiece •  Economic efficiency with large quantities • 

 Can be used in some cases without time-consuming post-processing

 Pour

 Definition casting

 Filling a mold with molten metal and solidifying it into a casting with the through the
 shape given geometry

 Basics of solidification
 Depending on the temperature gradient and the speed of solidification, the faster, the finer the  structure

 The solidification process is broken down into nucleation and nucleation growth

 3 


-----

###### • Fine-grained edge zone: strong supercooling on the mold wall -> many germs, fine-grained

**structure**

###### • Transcrystallization zone: Column-shaped coarser crystallites grow along the
 Temperature gradients from outside to inside

 • Globulistic structure inside the casting: Impurities have higher levels
 Melting temperature -> in the core of the casting -> increase the number of germs ->  more or less fine-grained, globulistic structure

 Volume contraction of metallic materials

 Eutectic: clearly determinable melting point

 liquid shrinkage

 solidification shrinkage

 Fixed shrinkage

 Effects: void formation & stress cracks

 4 


-----

###### Basic technical terms

**Model: Image of the cast workpiece taking shrinkage into account**

**• Permanent models: removal from the mold before casting (holt, metal, plastic, plaster) • Lost models:**

**one model per casting for complex castings (investment casting), melted/released**

**Shape: Cavity for receiving the melt**

**• Permanent mould: can be used repeatedly for the casting of non-ferrous metal materials (e.g.:**

**tailgate die casting)**

**• Lost molds: destruction during demoulding, mineral, refractory molding material and**

**binder**

**Core: Image of a cavity in the cast workpiece (e.g.: sand core in a cylinder head)**

###### Casting measures

**1) Infeed: vertical or oblique to reduce the infeed speed**

**2) Inlet: hold back impurities, hold back slag floating at the top**

**3) Outlet: Located lower so that clean material without slag is fed**

**4) Riser: Channels for excess material, at the same time reservoir to balance the**

**shrinkage and absorption of impurities**

###### 5) Wind whistles: pressure equalization through gas escape

**Classification of molding and casting processes**

**3) Formherstellung**

**4) Smelting of metals**

**6)**

**5)**

**Examples: gearbox housing, brake discs, exhaust manifold**

**• Investment casting**

**> Lost form with lost models**

**Advantages: freedom of design, high accuracy, high surface quality**

**Disadvantages: high effort, melting and firing furnaces**

**Examples: rims, turbine blades, transmission parts**

###### 6 


-----

**• Die-casting >**

**Permanent mold without models**

**> Molten material (mainly non-ferrous alloys) pressed at high pressure and high speed**

**into divided metallic permanent molds > Not with gravity, but with pressure -> also**

**in narrow cross-sections -> thin-walled possible**

**Machine must open, close and keep mold closed**

**(mold clamping unit) and press metal into shape (casting unit)**

**Examples: cross member, oil pan, clutch housing**

**Advantages**

**+ Narrowest cross-sections possible**

**+ Thin-walled and dimensionally accurate castings with high surface quality possible**

**+ High productivity**

**Disadvantages**

**- Not all metallic materials are possible**

**ÿ The profitability of the casting process increases with the batch size ÿ The**

**higher the quality requirements and the greater the effort involved in producing the mold, the**

**more expensive**

###### cast materials

**Non-ferrous metal casting materials: aluminum, magnesium, titanium alloys**

**Cast iron materials (2% < C content < 4%):**

**> White cast iron: high cooling rate, hard, brittle, wear-resistant, carbon as**

**Cement**

**> Gray cast iron (alloyed with silicon) -> Carbon as graphite, either with**

**Lamellar graphite (EN-GJL) or with spherical graphite (EN-GJS)**

**> Good primary forming, bad forming**

**> Dampening well -> cylinder and engine blocks**

###### styling guidelines

**True to form -> no**

**sharp inner edges**

**stress justice**

**-> Pay attention to the tensile and compressive loads**

###### 7 


-----

###### torpor justice
 -> Avoid accumulations of material and jumps  in wall thickness

 Editing Justice
 -> Avoid rework, note access for tools

 Archetypes – powder metallurgy
 Deals with the extraction of powders and their processing

 Definition of powder  metallurgy: Production of components from metal powders through a shaping process  (compacting) and subsequent heat treatment. Used when melting is to be avoided or is not  possible

**Advantages**

###### + Adjustable mechanical properties
 + Materials with a very high melting point can be processed
 + No grain flow -> isotropic strength properties
 + Narrow tolerances possible (mass, shape and size)

**Disadvantages**

###### - Undercuts cannot be produced with axial pressing

 - Pores degrade the mechanical properties and different shrinkage at
 inhomogeneous distribution

 Examples: valve guides, connecting rods, dust cap for car locks

 ÿ Application for material-specific reasons (material properties) or due to special 
 requirements (surface quality, dimensional tolerances)

**The higher the required density, the more expensive the component.**

**manufacturing process**

###### powder manufacture
 Pure metals and alloys
 quality control

 Mix

 Specially defined recipes

**The press**

###### Mechanical and hydraulic presses
 Powder is pressed into solid bodies

**Sintering**

###### Pressed "green parts" joined together by the  effect of heat

**Dimensional changes are precisely calculated in advance**

###### post-treatment
 And refinement by: calibrating, hardening,  oil soaking of bearings

**Powder production**

**Definition powder A**

**mass of particles whose diameter is smaller than 1mm (molded parts). Clumps of particles > 1mm are called granules**

**(metal filters), < 1 µm are called colloids (hard metal production).**

###### Irregularly shaped powders: good pressing and sintering behavior, unfavorable flow properties  (slow filling of the mold)
 Spherical powders: Better flow properties, lower sintering density

**Powder manufacturing process**

###### Depends on the physical and chemical properties of the material

 • Mechanical processes: The kinetic energy generated by the grinding unit is converted 
 into mechanical stresses -> brittle fracture or fracture as a result of being too strong
 strain hardening

 > For brittle metals

 • Atomization process: melt or locally melted material by gases,
 Liquids or ultrasound distributed in droplets -> Solidify quickly

 > For ductile metals

**> Compressed air and pressurized water are the most commonly used variants**

 High mixing quality, is annealed -> through
 Heterodiffusion processes forming a thin

**diffusion layer**

###### Ready-alloyed powder (pre-alloyed)
 Powder from atomized melts that are  already homogeneous
 Each particle has the alloy composition of the  finished sintered material ->  the highest process forces necessary for  compaction due to the spherical shape

### 10

###### Mechanical properties of sintered components

**Dependence of tensile strength and elongation at break on density and nickel content**

**Iron-nickel sintered alloys: 1) without Ni 2) with**

**2.5% by mass Ni 3) with**

**5% by mass Ni**

**Tensile strength increases with sinter density and nickel content**

**Elongation at break increases with sinter density and low nickel content**

###### axial pressing process

-----

**stripping procedure**

###### Fixed lower punch, moveable (drawn) die

 Homogeneous compaction

 Most commonly used procedure

 Compaction during axial pressing
 Force to overcome the friction between the powder grains, but also to overcome the

 Friction of the powder on the die wall necessary -> uneven density with one-sided compaction -

 > Improvement by two-sided -> almost uniform when floating or controlled moving matrix

 One-sided pressure effect Two-sided pressure effect
 Definition Sintern 

 Process by which a mass of particles - pressed or simply enclosed in a container - combines into a 

 coherent body under the influence of elevated temperature without all components melting

 Basic principle of sintering: the centers of the particles approach each other through diffusion processes 

 -> density increases -> pore structure changes -> body becomes smaller due to shrinkage. The final stage 

 is reached when only closed pores are left

 Liquid phase fractions have a sinter-accelerating and pore-filling effect, but also more sintering shrinkage. 

 Formed by melting a component.

 Alloy without liquid phase: Slow homogenization, low temperature, long sintering time

 Liquid phase sintering: Fast homogenization, high temperature, short sintering time

 Protective gas atmospheres, due to the increased tendency to react with the surrounding atmosphere due 

 to the porous structure (large surfaces).

 > Hydrogen (bronze, tungsten, molybdenum)

 > nitrogen (aluminum)

 > Cracked ammonia gas (iron, steel, silver)

###### molding A mixture of fine metal powder and binder (thermoplastic, approx. 30% by  volume) is pressed into a mold using an injection molding unit -> binder must be expelled after shaping.


###### Post-treatment of sintered parts 

 • Calibration

**components**

###### Features: no anisotropy, burrless forging, precise control of workpiece mass

**Examples: connecting rods, gears**

###### Powder injection 
 molding A mixture of fine metal powder and binder (thermoplastic, approx. 30% by  volume) is pressed into a mold using an injection molding unit -> binder must be expelled after shaping.
 High binder content improves sprayability, but more complex debinding. Productive and precise

 Examples: Deflection gears for electric toothbrushes, security locks

 Materials:

 > Iron, steels: near-net shape shaping (gears, functional parts)

 > Aluminum and titanium alloys: formability (low density and high strength)
 > Hard metals (composites made of metallic hard materials and binders (carbides and
 Nitride)) -> Cutting metals and highly stressed forming tools

**>**

###### styling guidelines
 Restricted by the pressing process, undercuts not possible:

 > Height/diameter ratio < 2.5 (slenderness)

 > Avoidance of sharp edges and acute angles
 > As few different diameters and lengths as possible

#### 13 


-----

###### min. 2mm, round off cross-section transitions

 Difficult to make stamps for inclined molds

 Avoid undercuts
 Machining grooves, undercuts, etc

 Avoid small heels, cone depressions difficult
 Blunt bottom holes are better

 Classification of forming processes according to stress states • 

 Compression forming: Predominant compressive stress state 
 in the workpiece -> upsetting

 • Shear forms: Shear stress condition in the workpiece

 moldable

 > Titanium alloys: very high strength, low density
 > Copper: easy to form, copper-tin (bronze) good for plain bearings

 upsetting

**Definition according to DIN 8583:**

###### Free forms, whereby a workpiece dimension is reduced between mostly flat, parallel active 
 surfaces.

 ÿ Basic process of forging/cold massive forming and model process for flow curve ÿ At the 

 beginning elastic part due to strain of sample, machine, tool

#### 15 


-----

**ÿ After that, the force increases exponentially due to strain hardening ÿ Bulging due**

**to friction at the end faces (without friction it would be**

**an ideal cylinder)**

###### Forge

**> Improvement of the structure**

**> Higher strength and better surface than casting**

**> Favorable fiber flow**

###### open die forging

**> Tools that are not tied to the shape of the workpiece**

**> Goal: mass distribution**

**Thorns** **piercing** **Drop** **twisting**

**generation of a** **extension** **manufacturing** **Forming using**

###### Hohlraumes  cavity to hole Jumpy rotary motion

**cross-sectional change**

###### drop forging

**> Tools linked to workpiece shape**

###### > Goal: dimensional and shape accuracy

**> Tool contains engraving (negative form of the workpiece)**

###### Material flow in forging

### 16

###### Push through and push through

 > The shaping tool is the nozzle (die)

 > Flow & piece goods possible

 Extrusion process

 > Pressing through a workpiece between two tool parts using a punch

**> General cargo production**

###### > Combination of material flow direction (forward, reverse, cross extrusion) and geometry

 (solid, hollow, cup extrusion) of the finished part fully characterizes extrusion processes

 Requirements for machine tools for bulk forming

 > Short pressure contact time (workpiece very warm)

 > High working capacity (increase the forming force)

 > High number of strokes (often with large batch sizes -> high parts output necessary)

### 17

###### rollers

**Is continuous or incremental pressure forming with one or more rotating tools with or without additional tools**

**> Characterized by compressive stresses**

###### > Classification based on the kinematics of the

**Workpiece relative to the roller**

**Classification of the forming zones possible**

**lag and lead zone and flow sheath**

**cold rolled strips**

**> Crack and pore-free surface**

**> Tight thickness tolerances**

**> flatness**

##### Forming - sheet metal forming

**Forming is manufacturing by plastically changing the shape of a solid body**

**Examples: Coke can (0.1mm), kidney bowl (0.5mm), cooking pot (0.7mm)**

**ÿ Especially important in the production of automobiles ÿ Especially for large**

**components and components with constant wall thickness ÿ To assess formability: tensile test**

**(tensile strength, yield point, elongation at break)**

**Anisotropy: different properties in different directions. The directional dependency of the material behavior**

**is more important for sheet metal than for solid workpieces.**

**During a cold deformation, new dislocations are created -> dammed up and blocked ->**

**solidification**

**Tribology: Interaction of friction, lubrication, wear, etc. influenced by both semi-finished product and tool ->**

**lubrication with great importance**

**Typical failure cases:**

**wrinkling** **Ground ripper**

**Classification of forming processes according to stress states**

**tension compression forming** **drawing** **bending forming**

**deep drawing**

###### Is the compression molding of a sheet metal section into a hollow body or compression molding of a
 Hollow body with a smaller circumference without intentionally changing the sheet thickness

 The first step is deep drawing in a first processing step -> diameter change limited -> further forming 
 steps for further changes

 The body (tensile stress in the axial direction) transfers the drawing force from the bottom of  the body to the actual forming zone

 Hold-down prevents creases from forming

 Drawing ratio ÿ characterizes the formability of a material and depends on the material, temperature,  sheet thickness, etc.

#### 19 


-----

###### Stress states during deep drawing

**> Result from its position in the workpiece**

**flange area** **Ziehringradius** **Accusation**

**compressive and tensile stresses** **Bending stress** **Only tensile stress**

###### Stretch 

 forming Forming of a solid body, whereby the plastic state is essentially brought about by  uniaxial or multiaxial tensile stresses.

**A thinning of the material is intended. The subsequent flow of material is deliberately prevented.**

**Especially used for large components that are produced in small series (outer skin components Airbus A320)**

**Easy stretching** **Tangential stretch forming**

###### Sheet metal clamped in a rotatably  First stretched to yield point (causes even  mounted clamping ring -> move  stretching)

 the stamp into the sheet metal -> rests against the tool Then applied tangentially to the tool

#### 20 


-----

###### bending forming

 > Bringing about the plastic state through bending stress

 Bending angle over plunge  Sheet metal strips pulled through dies depth of the punch

 One leg is firmly clamped, the  V: First, free bending process other is swiveling U: Legs fold up and lay against 
 bending beam bent stamps

 Assumptions of the elementary bending theory

 > Bending only by a moment

 > The neutral fiber coincides with the line of symmetry
 > Sheet thickness remains constant

 Springback depends on yield strength and strain hardening.
 The higher the yield point, the higher the springback.

 Materials:

 > Steel: Affected and alloyed by carbon
 > Aluminum: Also alloyed

 Tailored blanks: Different materials or materials with different sheet thicknesses, joined by laser 

 welding in order to use thicker sheet metal areas (cars, side part)

 Heat treatment  Aims before and during forming: Set desired material properties for processing  (reduction of yield stress, reduction of residual stresses).

 Process: soft annealing, recrystallization annealing

#### 21 


-----

###### Application example press hardening

**> Process combination of hot sheet metal forming and tempering in one step**

**> Extension of the formability by increasing the temperature**

**> Increase in strength through hardening -> cooling at 30 K/s**

**> Example: B-pillar reinforcement of a car in the body shell**

**Goals after forming: Improvement of component properties, improvement of machinability.**

**Process: Normalizing, recovery annealing, hardening, tempering, tempering**

###### Separate

**Definition:**

**Manufacture by changing the shape of a solid body, where cohesion is locally eliminated, ie reduced as a whole**

###### > Classification into cutting, machining, removing, disassembling

 Slicing (no chips)

**Shear cutting: Cutting mostly with two cutting edges, which against each other with little lateral**

**be moved offset -> very productive**

**Classification according to the position of the cutting edge:**

**• Closed cut:**

**• Open cut:**

#### 22 


-----

**Classification according to the position of the cutting edges**

**Full edge cutting**

**Full length at the same time**

**Cross cutting**

**Always only to a partial length of the cutting line**

**Power requirement and noise emission lower**

###### Procedure for shear cutting

**1** **1**

**1**

**Stamp rests on sheet metal**

**First elastic, then plastic** **Stamp in sheet metal, edge deduction**

**High forces, shear zone is**

**formed**

**2** **2** **3**

**Continue stamping into sheet metal** **Cracks also on the stamp side** **ejection of the workpiece**

**Cracks in shear zone** **Formation of the fracture area**

#### 23 


-----

###### 1) Deformation phase: highest forces
 2) Shear phase: Decrease in force, first crack occurs later
 Reaching the maximum load point
 3) Fracture phase: Severe drop in cutting force

### interface formation

**on**

**b**

**hG**

**tE**

###### Cutting gap size •  Too small: Friction between the knives and heavy wear

 • Too large: formation of burrs, uneven surface

 • Correctly dimensioned: crack systems grow together

#### 24 


-----

###### Shear cutting error

**> Formal errors: edge removal, tear depth, burr height**

**> Dimensional errors due to wear of the cutting edges, plastic and elastic deformation of the**

**workpiece**

**> Positional errors: Angular errors in the cut surfaces, misalignment of openings in relation to one another**

###### fineblanking

**> Smooth and tear-free cut surfaces, separation is carried out by pure shearing without breakage**

**Burrs can occur**

###### Fineblanking process

**Difference to normal shear cutting:**

**- Press plate mit Ringzacke**

**- Counterholder**

**- Very small cutting gap**

**- Requires high precision tooling and triple action press**

###### Nibble cutting / nibbling

**> Continuous, multi-stroke punching, one-off to series production**

#### 25

###### Joining  Definition Joining is the long-term joining of workpieces of a geometrically defined 
 shape. Cohesion (with or without formless matter) is created locally and increased as a whole.

 Classification by type of cohesion

 connection based on e.g. riveting, folding eg soldering, welding
 Normal force and friction
 Examples: wedges, clamps,
 Screwing, shrinking

 Joining by forming
 ÿ When joining by forming, the parts to be joined are formed locally

 Hemming is bending to join metal sheets at their edges

**Fold types:**

#### 26 


-----

###### Clinching, especially the TOX round point

**> Die geometry causes the formation of an undercut**

**> Non-positive and positive connection**

**> Examples: Body construction, rear cover, front flap**

###### Joining by welding 
 Welding is the joining of materials in the welding zone using heat

**and/or power with or without filler metal. It can be facilitated by welding aids.**

**The necessary energy is supplied from outside**

**The weld zone is the localized area in which the material is brought into a slightly plastically deformable or**

**liquid state.**

###### Cohesive connection, cannot be removed without destruction.

**Divided into pressure joint welding and fusion welding**

###### Parameters influencing weldability

**Weldability is given if the material connection can be achieved by welding**

**• Weldability -> material (chemical composition/metallurgical properties) • Weldability -> production (execution**

**of the welding work) • Welding safety -> construction (type of stress, material**

**properties)**

###### Press connection welding

**> Is welding using force without welding additives**

**> Resistance pressure welding: Heat is generated by electrical resistance in the**

**Welding zone created -> no welding filler required, short welding times**

**• Spot welding: electrode force -> high current, low**

**Tension, short time -> heated to melting point -> lenticular**

**Connection**

**> Low-alloy steels and aluminum alloys**

**> Examples: Frame structure in body construction -> fully automated**

**spot welding**

###### •Rührreibschweißen 

 >Rotating tool along the joint line

 >Tool with coaxial protruding pin
 >Material is not melted, but rather bonded together  in a solid phase

 >This also reduces and increases component distortion

 component accuracy

**>Application: door panels in automobile construction**

###### fusion joint welding

 > Is welding with localized melt flow without the application of force, with or without filler material

 • Manual metal arc welding: the world's most commonly  used welding process

 >The rod electrode is connected to the workpiece as 

 opposite poles, an arc is ignited between them

 >Additional material dripping from the electrode is passed through

 Lorentz force accelerates towards the workpiece

 >Example: CT basic body

 Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)
 The area in which the initial structure changes is laterally limited by the melting line

#### 28 


-----

###### Joining by soldering

**> Thermal process for joining and coating metallic materials using a**

**melted additional metal (solder), if necessary flux/soldering protective gases**

**> In contrast to welding, lower melting point than the base material**

**> Solders made of pure metals or alloys in the form of wire, rods, powder, etc.**

**> Heating of the joining surfaces and the solder**

**> Melting of the solder**

**> Wetting of the joining partners**

**> Soft soldering up to 450°C (use of fluxes promotes thermal contact of the**

**joining partners and the solder, detachment and removal of newly forming oxides)**

**> Ab 450°C Hartlöten**

**> From 900°C high-temperature soldering (use of protective gases, removal of the**

**surface oxides)**

**workpiece**

**> Example: Al bicycle frame**

**plasma welding**

**> Plasma welding arc**

**> Two process gases: plasma gas (argon) to generate the**

**Arc and shielding gas to displace**

**atmospheric gases**

**> Arc is constricted -> higher intensity, lower**

###### beam divergence

**> On impact: kinetic energy -> thermal energy**

**> Arcing inside the torch and escaping the hot**

**gases as a jet**

**TIG welding vs. plasma welding**

**Plasma: Arc is bundled, tungsten electrode is inside -> higher temperatures -> active**

**cooling required**

**> Higher intensity**

**> Narrow heat-affected zone**

**> Narrower welds**

**Advantages:**

**+ Exact process control**

**+ Low distortion, favorable seam shape**

###### + Large sheet thicknesses possible

**+ High speeds possible**

**Disadvantages:**

**Narrower & deeper**

**- Cost**

**- No gap bridging possible**
